# EnglishGraph

Test project for a syntactic approach to English parsing.
Grammatical and syntactical rules can be used to determine the likelihood of a word POS and its links to other words. 
For instance, linking:
- ing suffix --> verb gerundive, associated to link
Being able to extract those rule automatically and with enough precision could probably improve the current state of the art in POS tagging.
